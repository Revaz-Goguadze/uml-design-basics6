# UML Design Basics

A beginner level task for practicing creating and designing classes using UML diagrams for describing class structure and behavior.  

Before starting with the task learn the basics of [UML language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) and [UML Class Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram). Search YouTube for [relevant video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=uml+class+diagram) to get started quickly. Don't waste time! You don't have to master the UML Class Diagrams. You just need to get a [basic understanding on the topic](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/object_oriented_analysis_design/ooad_uml_basic_notation.htm), and you can always find the answer to your question in the [UML Class Diagrams Reference](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-reference.html). 

Estimated time to complete the task: 6h.


## Task

The task has twenty four sections with small sub-tasks. After completing a section, read materials in "Additional Reading" section and answer the questions in "Step Questions" section. 


### Visual Studio

Visual Studio has a special feature to help you quickly find specified items. You can go to a specific file, type, symbol or class member with [Go To commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/go-to). Navigation with Go To commands is much more productive than using Solution Explorer pane.

Visual Studio Code has similar features for [quick file navigation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_quick-file-navigation).


### 1. Static Class

Open the [SimpleStaticClass1.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleStaticClass1.cs) file, and add the code to declare a new [static class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-static-class-members) with the name `SimpleStaticClass1`. The class should have [`public`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/public) [access modifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers) and no class members.

Example 1. The declaration of a static class.

```cs
public static class SimpleStaticClass1
{
}
```

Class diagram 1. The `SimpleStaticClass1` static class. 

![Class Diagram for SimpleStaticClass1](./images/simple-static-class1.png).

NB: "&lt;&lt;static&gt;&gt;" is a custom [UML stereotype](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/stereotype.html), not a standard UML notation. That means the representation of a static class may be different on other class diagrams.

### Additional Reading

* [What is a "static" class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/695056/what-is-a-static-class)

### Step Questions

* What is a static class?
* What UML notation is used to describe a static class on a class diagram?
* How to declare a static class?
* What does it mean for a class to have a "public" access modifier?


### 2. Static Fields

Open the [SimpleStaticClass2.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleStaticClass2.cs) file, add the code to declare the new public static class with the name `SimpleStaticClass2`, and add the [static fields](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-static-class-members#static-members) using the information from the table below:

| Field Name   | Field Type | Field Access Modifier | UML Visibility Type |
|--------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| intField     | int        | private               | -                   |
| longField    | long       | private               | -                   |
| floatField   | float      | private               | -                   |
| doubleField  | double     | private               | -                   |
| CharField    | char       | public                | +                   |
| BooleanField | bool       | public                | +                   |
| StringField  | string     | public                | +                   |
| ObjectField  | object     | public                | +                   |

Example 2. Static field declaration.

```cs
private static int intField;
```

Class diagram 2. The `SimpleStaticClass2` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleStaticClass2](./images/simple-static-class2.png).

Class diagram explanation:
* The `-` sign before an [attribute](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/property.html#classifier-attribute) name defines the ["private" visibility type](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/visibility.html?context=class-diagrams). That means a class field should have a [`private` access modifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/private).
* The `+` sign before an attribute name defines the "public" visibility type. That means a class field should have the [`public` access modifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/public).
* [Underlined](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-core.html#static-feature) class attributes - the class fields should have the [`static` modifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/static).

If C# compiler will report the SA1202 StyleCop warning during the project compilation, read the [rule description on the documentation page](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/blob/master/documentation/SA1202.md) and fix an instance of this violation by changing the order of the class fields.

![SA1202 StyleCop](./images/sa1202.png)

The [SimpleStaticClass2.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleStaticClass2.cs) file contains a bunch of [pragma preprocessor directives](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives) at the beginning to suppress issue reporting by the code analysis tools.

* Code analysis tools treat non-constant public or protected fields as a suspicious code. Read the [SA1401](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/blob/master/documentation/SA1401.md) and [CA2211](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2211) documentation pages to get more details why having private fields is important for code maintainability. 

```cs
#pragma warning disable SA1401  // Fields should be private
#pragma warning disable CA2211  // Non-constant fields should not be visible
#pragma warning disable S2223   // Non-constant static fields should not be visible
#pragma warning disable S1104   // Fields should not have public accessibility
```

* The class fields are not used anywhere in the code, and compiler treats unused private fields as a suspicious code. Read the [CA1823](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/CA1823) and [CS0169](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0169) documentation pages to get more details.

```cs
#pragma warning disable CA1823  // Avoid unused private fields
#pragma warning disable CS0169  // Field is never used
#pragma warning disable S1144   // Unused private types or members should be removed
#pragma warning disable IDE0051 // Remove unused private members
```

* What is the difference between public and private accessibility levels?
* What is the difference between public and private access modifiers?
* What UML notation is used to describe a static field on a class diagram?


### 3. Static Methods

Open the [SimpleStaticClass3.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleStaticClass3.cs) file, add the code to declare a new public static class with the name `SimpleStaticClass3`, and add the [static methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-static-class-members#static-members) using the information from the table below:

| Method Name    | Return Type | Return Value | Field Access Modifier | UML Visibility Type |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| GetInteger     | int         | -101         | private               | -                   |
| GetLongInteger | long        | 101          | public                | +                   |
| GetFloat       | float       | 1.01         | private               | -                   |
| GetDouble      | double      | 0.101        | public                | +                   |
| GetChar        | char        | 'a'          | public                | +                   |
| GetBoolean     | bool        | true         | private               | -                   |
| GetString      | string      | "abc"        | public                | +                   |
| GetObject      | object      | null         | private               | -                   |

A method should return a literal as a return value. 

Example 3. Static method declaration.

```cs
private static int GetInteger()
{
    return -101;
}
```

### 4. Static Fields Initialization

Analyze the class diagram below and add the `SimpleStaticClass4` static class code to the [SimpleStaticClass4.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleStaticClass4.cs) file. 

Class diagram 4. The `SimpleStaticClass4` static class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleStaticClass4](./images/simple-static-class4.png).

Add field initializers for all static fields using the values from the table below:

| Field Name   | Field Initializer Value    |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| intField     | 212                        |
| longField    | -232                       |
| floatField   | 2.12                       |
| doubleField  | 2.121                      |
| charField    | 'b'                        |
| booleanField | true                       |
| stringField  | "def"                      |
| objectField  | typeof(SimpleStaticClass4) |

Example 4.1. The field initializer usage.

```cs
private static int intField = 212;
```

Implement the static methods to return the relevant values of the private static fields. 

Example 4.2. Accessing a static field in a static method using a class name.

```cs
public static int GetInteger()
{
    return SimpleStaticClass4.intField;
}
```

The code analysis tools report the [IDE0002](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0002) issue, because the static method can get an access to another static class members without specifying the class name.

![IDE0002 Warning](./images/ide0002.png)

Example 4.3. Accessing a static field in a static method without using a class name.

```cs
public static int GetInteger()
{
    return intField;
}
```
Both in 4.2 and 4.3 examples are equivalent. 

You can use the "Simplify member access" refactoring technique in the Visual Studio to optimize the code of the static methods in the `SimpleStaticClass4` class.

![Simplify member access](./images/ide0002-refactoring.png)


### 5. The Class

Open the [SimpleClass1.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass1.cs) file, and add the code to declare a new public [class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes) with the name `SimpleClass1`. The class should have no class members.

Example 5. Class declaration.

```cs
public class SimpleClass1
{
}
```

Class diagram 5. The `SimpleClass1` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass1](./images/simple-class1.png).

#### Additional Reading

Read the [Objects - create instances of types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/object-oriented/objects) article to understand the class and object concepts.

> A class or struct definition is like a blueprint that specifies what the type can do. An object is basically a block of memory that has been allocated and configured according to the blueprint. A program may create many objects of the same class. Objects are also called instances, and they can be stored in either a named variable or in an array or collection.

Read the [Objects and Classes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/object_oriented_analysis_design/ooad_object_oriented_model.htm) section in the "OOAD" tutorial:

> A class represents a collection of objects having same characteristic properties that exhibit common behavior. It gives the blueprint or description of the objects that can be created from it. Creation of an object as a member of a class is called instantiation. Thus, object is an instance of a class.

Also, read the [Reference types and Declaring Classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes#declaring-classes) sections.

#### Step Questions

* What is the difference between the class and the object concepts?
* What is the difference between the static class and the non-static class?
* Is it possible for a static class to have a non-static class member?
* Is it possible for a non-static class to have a static class member?
* What UML notation is used to describe a class on a class diagram?


### 6. Instance Fields

Open the [SimpleClass2.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass2.cs) file, and add the code to declare the new public `SimpleClass2` class with [instance fields](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields) using the information from the table below:

| Field Name   | Field Type | Field Access Modifier |
|--------------|------------|-----------------------|
| IntField     | int        | public                |
| longField    | long       | private               |
| FloatField   | float      | public                |
| DoubleField  | double     | public                |
| charField    | char       | private               |
| BooleanField | bool       | public                |
| stringField  | string     | private               |
| objectField  | object     | private               |

Example 6. Declaration of an instance field.

```cs
public int IntField;
```

Class diagram 6. The `SimpleClass2` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass2](./images/simple-class2.png).

Class diagram explanation:
* Class attributes in the diagram are not underlined - the class fields should not have the `static` modifier.
* The `+` and `-` signs before an attribute name define the `public` and `private` visibility types. 

#### Additional Reading

Read [Objects and Classes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/object_oriented_analysis_design/ooad_object_oriented_model.htm) to understand the state and the behavior concepts:  

> State that determines the characteristic properties of an object as well as the values of the properties that the object holds.

> Behavior that represents externally visible activities performed by an object in terms of changes in its state.

The state of an object of the `SimpleClass2` class is a set of the `SimpleClass2` fields and the values of these fields.

A class with fields only is a simple [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure). 

#### Step Questions

* What is a class field?
* What is the difference between the class state and the class behavior concepts?
* What is the difference between the static and non-static class fields?
* Does the SimpleClass2 class have the class state and behavior?
* What UML notation is used to describe a class field on a class diagram?


### 7. Class Instantiation

Open the [CreatingSimpleClass2](UmlDesignBasics/CreatingSimpleClass2.cs) class, and add the implementation for `CreateSimpleClass2` method - a method should create a new object of `SimpleClass2` class and set all public fields.

| Field Name   | Value  |
|--------------|--------|
| IntField     | -331   |
| FloatField   | 13.13  |
| DoubleField  | -31.31 |
| BooleanField | true   |

Example 7.1. The `SimpleClass2` class instantiation (creating an instance of).

```cs
SimpleClass2 simpleClass = new SimpleClass2();

simpleClass.IntField = -331;
// TODO: set other fields here

return simpleClass;
```

Add the implementation for `CreateSimpleClass2ObjectInitializer` method - a method should create a new object of `SimpleClass2` class and set all public fields by using an _object initializer_.

| Field Name   | Value   |
|--------------|---------|
| IntField     | 432     |
| FloatField   | -42.31  |
| DoubleField  | 43.12   |
| BooleanField | false   |

Example 7.2. Initializing an object of the `SimpleClass2` class by using an object initializer.

```cs
return new SimpleClass2
{
    IntField = 432,
    // TODO: set other fields here
};
```

The objects returned by `CreateSimpleClass2` and `CreateSimpleClass2ObjectInitializer` methods has the **state** only, the object has no **behavior**. The state of each object is **different** because the objects contain different values in their fields.

* [How to initialize objects by using an object initializer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-initialize-objects-by-using-an-object-initializer)

#### Step Questions

* What keyword is used for creating an instance of a class?
* How to use object initializers to initialize an instance of the SimpleClass2 class?


### 8. Instance Methods

Open [SimpleClass3.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass3.cs) file, and add the code to declare a new public `SimpleClass3` class with [instance class method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/methods) using the information from the table below:

| Method Name    | Return Value    |
|----------------|-----------------|
| GetInteger     | MaxValue        |
| GetLong        | MinValue        |
| GetFloat       | Epsilon         |
| GetDouble      | NaN             |
| GetChar        | 'c'             |
| GetBoolean     | true            |
| GetString      | "abcdef"        |
| GetObject      | new object()    |

Example 8. The declaration of an instance method.

```cs
public int GetInteger()
{
    return int.MaxValue;
}
```

Class diagram 8. The `SimpleClass3` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass3](./images/simple-class3.png).

Class diagram explanation:
* Class [operations](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/operation.html) in the diagram are not underlined - the class methods should not have the `static` modifier.
* The `+` sign before the [operation](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/operation.html) name defines the "public" visibility type. That means the instance methods should have a `public` access modifier.

#### Step Questions

* What is a class method?
* What is the difference between a static and non-static class method?
* Is it possible to access a public instance method from the outside of a class?

```cs
SimpleClass3 obj = new SimpleClass3();
int i = obj.GetInteger(); // ?
```
* What UML notation is used to describe an instance method on a class diagram?


### 9. Data Hiding

Open [SimpleClass4](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass4.cs) class. The class has public instance fields already, but having public instance fields in your classes may lead to runtime issues. That's why code analysis tools report the _SA1401_ and _CA1051_ warnings for the `SimpleClass4` class.

Refactor the code using [Encapsulate Field](https://refactoring.guru/encapsulate-field) (use Java code snippet as an example) technique to hide all instance fields. 

Class diagram 9. The `SimpleClass4` class after refactoring.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass4](./images/simple-class4.png).

The code analysis tools report the [IDE0009](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0009) and [SA1101](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/blob/master/documentation/SA1101.md) warnings, because of the code style preferences.

![IDE0009 Warning](./images/ide0009.png)

Use `this` qualifier to access instance members.

![Add this](./images/ide0009-refactoring.png)

#### Additional Reading

Read [Encapsulation and Data Hiding](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/object_oriented_analysis_design/ooad_object_oriented_model.htm) section to understand the encapsulation and data hiding concepts:

> Encapsulation is the process of binding both attributes and methods together within a class. Through encapsulation, the internal details of a class can be hidden from outside. It permits the elements of the class to be accessed from outside only through the interface provided by the class.

> Typically, a class is designed such that its data (attributes) can be accessed only by its class methods and insulated from direct outside access. This process of insulating an object’s data is called data hiding or information hiding.

The private fields of `SimpleClass4` are "insulated from direct outside access". These fields can be accessed only by its class methods since they have `private` access modifier.

Read [Objects and Classes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/object_oriented_analysis_design/ooad_object_oriented_model.htm) section to understand the behavior concept:

> Behavior that represents externally visible activities performed by an object in terms of changes in its state.

"Externally visible activities" are the class "set"-methods. Those methods are performed by a `SimpleClass4` object in terms of changes in its state.

#### Step Questions

* Explain the encapsulation and data hiding concepts.
* Is it possible to access a private class field from the outside of a class?

```cs
SimpleClass4 obj = new SimpleClass4();
int i = obj.intField; // ?
```

* Is it possible to access a private class field from a class method?

```cs
public int GetLong()
{
    return this.intField + this.longField; // ?
}
```

* Does the SimpleClass4 class have the class state and behavior?
* What steps has the "Encapsulate Field" refactoring technique?
* What UML notation is used to define a public and private visibility types for a class member on a class diagram?


### 10. Instance Fields Initialization

Create the new `SimpleClass5` in the [SimpleClass5.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass5.cs) file, copy all instance fields and "get" instance methods from `SimpleClass4` class to the `SimpleClass5` class, and add field initializers using the information from the table below:

| Field Name   | Field Initializer Value    |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| intField     | -216                       |
| longField    | -621                       |
| floatField   | -54.62                     |
| doubleField  | -62.054                    |
| charField    | 'd'                        |
| booleanField | true                       |
| stringField  | "defabc"                   |
| objectField  | typeof(int)                |

Example 10. The field initializer for an instance field.

```cs
private int intField = -216;
```

Class diagram 10. The `SimpleClass5` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass5](./images/simple-class5.png).

An object of the `SimpleClass5` class is [immutable](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/all-about-c-sharp-immutable-classes2/) because the class has no methods that can change an object _state_.

### Step Questions

* How to initialize a class field using a field initializers when a class is instantiated?
* Whether the SimpleClass5 class is immutable or mutable class? Why? 


### 11. Parameterless Constructor

Create the new `SimpleClass6` class in the [SimpleClass6.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass6.cs) file, copy all instance fields and "get" instance methods from `SimpleClass4` class to the `SimpleClass6` class, and add public [default parameterless constructor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors).

Add the code for initializing class fields to the constructor using the information from the table below:

| Field Name   | Field Initializer Value    |
|--------------|----------------------------|

| longField    | 721                        |
| floatField   | -76.67                     |
| doubleField  | 372.127                    |

| stringField  | "ghi"                      |
| objectField  | typeof(float)              |

Example 11. Parameterless constructor.

```cs
private int intField;
// other fields

public SimpleClass6()
{
    this.intField = 754;
    // TODO: set other fields here
}
```

NB: "&lt;&lt;constructor&gt;&gt;" is a custom [UML stereotype](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/stereotype.html), not a standard UML notation. A UML class diagram may have [other notation for constructors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4006868/uml-classdiagram-constructor-with-parameters).

### Step Questions

* What is a class constructor?
* How to declare a parameterless constructor for a class?
* How to initialize a class field using a parameterless constructor when a class is instantiated?
* Whether the SimpleClass6 class is immutable or mutable class? Why?


### 12. Constructor with Parameters

Create the new `SimpleClass7` class in the [SimpleClass7.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass7.cs) file, copy all instance fields and "get" instance methods from `SimpleClass4` class to the `SimpleClass7` class, and add a public [constructor with parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors).

Add the code for initializing class fields to the constructor using the information from the table below:

| Constructor Parameter | Field To Set |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| intValue              | intField     |
| longValue             | longField    |
| floatValue            | floatField   |
| doubleValue           | doubleField  |
| charValue             | charField    |
| boolValue             | booleanField |
| stringValue           | stringField  |
| objectValue           | objectField  |

Example 12. The declaration of a constructor with parameters.

```cs
private int intField;
// other fields

public SimpleClass7(
    int intValue
    // TODO: add other parameters
)
{
    this.intField = intValue;
    // TODO: set other fields here
}
```

### 13. Properties

Create the new `SimpleClass8` class in the [SimpleClass8.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass8.cs) file, copy all instance fields and instance methods from `SimpleClass4` class to the `SimpleClass8` class.

Refactor the class code to replace all "get" and "set" methods with [properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties).

| Backing Field Name | Property Name |
|--------------------|---------------|
| intField           | IntValue      |
| longField          | LongValue     |
| floatField         | FloatValue    |
| doubleField        | DoubleValue   |
| charField          | CharValue     |
| booleanField       | BooleanValue  |
| stringField        | StringValue   |
| objectField        | ObjectValue   |

Read about _backing fields_ on [Fields documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields):

> A private field that stores the data exposed by a public property is called a backing store or backing field.

Example 13.1. The declaration of a property with "get" and "set" accessors.

```cs
private int intField; // intField is the "backing field"

public int IntValue
{
    get
    {
        return this.intField;
    }
    set
    {
        this.intField = value;
    }
}
```

Class diagram 13. The `SimpleStaticClass8` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass8](./images/simple-class8.png).

NB: "&lt;&lt;get&gt;&gt;" and "&lt;&lt;set&gt;&gt;" are custom [UML stereotypes](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/stereotype.html), not a standard UML notation. A UML class diagram has no special notation for "properties". That's why using a custom stereotype is the only way to define the property.

Another way to implement a property is to use [expression body definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members#properties).

Example 13.2. The declaration of a property with the "get" and "set" accessors using [expression body definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#expression-body-definitions).

```cs
public int IntValue
{
    get => this.intField;
    set => this.intField = value;
}
```

Visual Studio has a feature for converting "get" and "set" methods to properties - [Convert Get method to property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/convert-get-method-to-property).

![Convert Get method to property](./images/replace-getter-setter-with-property.png).

### Step Questions

* What is a property?
* What is a backing field?
* What is the purpose of property get and set accessors?
* How to use expression body definition for implementing a property?
* Whether the SimpleClass8 class is immutable or mutable class? Why?
* What refactoring feature has Visual Studio for converting get and set methods to properties?


### 14. Auto-implemented Properties

Create the new `SimpleClass9` class in the [SimpleClass9.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass9.cs) file, copy all instance properties from `SimpleClass8` class to the `SimpleClass9` class.

The code analysis tools report the [IDE0032](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0032) and _S2292_ issues.

![Use auto property](./images/ide0032.png)

Refactor the class code to replace all properties with [auto-implemented properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#auto-implemented-properties).

Example 14. The declaration of an auto-implemented property.

```cs
public int IntValue { get; set; }
```

Class diagram 14. The `SimpleStaticClass9` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass9](./images/simple-class9.png).

NB: "&lt;&lt;property&gt;&gt;" is a custom [UML stereotype](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/stereotype.html), not a standard UML notation. A UML class diagram has no special notation for "properties". That's why [using a custom stereotype](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/470097/how-to-represent-a-c-sharp-property-in-uml) is the only way to define the property.

Visual Studio has a feature for converting a property to auto-implemented property - [Convert between auto property and full property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/convert-between-auto-property-and-full-property).

![Convert between auto property and full property](./images/use-auto-properties.png).

### Step Questions

* What is an auto-implemented property?
* Does an auto-implemented property have a backing field?
* Does an auto-implemented property have get and set accessors?
* What is the default accessibility level for get and set accessors (in example 14)?
* Whether the SimpleClass9 class is immutable or mutable class? Why?
* What refactoring feature has Visual Studio for converting between an auto-implemented property and a full property?


### 15. Private Setters

Create the new `SimpleClass10` class in [SimpleClass10.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass10.cs) file, copy all instance properties from `SimpleClass9` class and make all "set" accessors _private_.

Example 15.1. The declaration of a property with the private "set" accessor.

```cs
public int IntValue { get; private set; }
```

Add a new public constructor with parameters (like in the step #12) or [generate a constructor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/generate-constructor) with Visual Studio.

Class diagram 15. The `SimpleStaticClass10` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass10](./images/simple-class10.png).

A compiler will raise an error in case you will try to assign a value to a property with private setter.

Example 15.2. Assigning a value to a property with private setter.

```cs
SimpleClass10 obj;
obj.IntValue = 10; // Compiler error: [CS0200] Property or indexer 'SimpleClass10.IntValue' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only
```

### Step Questions

* What access modifiers a get or set property accessor may have?
* Is it possible to access a property with private get accessor?

```cs
class MyClass {
    public int Value { private get; set; }
}

MyClass obj = new MyClass();
int i = obj.Value; // ?
```

* Is it possible to assign a value to a property with private set accessor?

```cs
class MyClass {
    public int Value { get; private set; }
}

MyClass obj = new MyClass();
obj.Value = 1; // ?
```

* Is it possible to have a property with both private get and set accessors?

```cs
class MyClass {
    public int Value { private get; private set; }
}
```

* Whether the SimpleClass10 class is immutable or mutable class? Why?
* What refactoring feature has Visual Studio for converting between an auto-implemented property and a full property?


### 16. Encapsulation

_Encapsulation_ concept doesn't have a strict definition. The meaning of the concept may be different in various sources. 

[Object oriented programming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/object-oriented/) article:

> According to the principle of encapsulation, a class or struct can specify how accessible each of its members is to code outside of the class or struct. Methods and variables that aren't intended to be used from outside of the class or assembly can be hidden to limit the potential for coding errors or malicious exploits.

[Object-Oriented programming (C#)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop) article:

> Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.

[Encapsulation and Data Hiding](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/object_oriented_analysis_design/ooad_object_oriented_model.htm) section:

> Encapsulation is the process of binding both attributes and methods together within a class. Through encapsulation, the internal details of a class can be hidden from outside. It permits the elements of the class to be accessed from outside only through the interface provided by the class.

[Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) article in Wikipedia:

> In object-oriented programming, encapsulation refers to the **bundling of data with the methods** that operate on that data, or the **restricting of direct access** to some of an object's components. Encapsulation is used to **hide the values or state** of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them. Publicly accessible methods are generally provided in the class (so-called "getters" and "setters") to access the values, and other client classes call these methods to retrieve and modify the values within the object.

Students often treat "encapsulation" concept as "data hiding", but the concept has other meaning - "bundling of data with the methods".


### 17. Constructor Overloading

Create the new `SimpleClass11` class in the [SimpleClass11.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass11.cs) file, and copy all instance properties from the `SimpleClass10` class to the `SimpleClass11` class.

Class diagram 17. The `SimpleClass11` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass11](./images/simple-class11.png).

Add eight public constructors with one parameter (see the class diagram above), and initialize the instance properties with values from the table below:

| Property      | Default Constructor Value |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| IntValue      | 8374                      |
| LongValue     | -8124                     |
| FloatValue    | -889.542                  |
| DoubleValue   | 89238.0809                |
| CharValue     | 'f'                       |
| BooleanValue  | false                     |
| StringValue   | "jklmno"                  |
| ObjectValue   | null                      |

A relevant instance property should be initialized with a constructor parameter value. 

Example 17.1. The declaration of the public constructor with `int` parameter.

```cs
public SimpleClass11(int intValue)
{
    this.IntValue = intValue; // initialize IntValue property with constructor parameter value 
    this.LongValue = -8124; // initialize other properties with default values
    this.FloatValue = -889.542F;
    this.DoubleValue = 89238.0809;
    this.CharValue = 'f';
    this.BooleanValue = false;
    this.StringValue = "jklmno";
    this.ObjectValue = null;
}
```

Having constructors with different set of parameters is called [constructor overloading](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/call-chain-constructors-csharp).

Having no parameterless constructor makes it not possible to create an object of the class without specifying any parameters.

Example 17.2. The class instantiation without a parameterless constructor.

```cs
SimpleClass11 obj = new SimpleClass11(); // Compiler error: [CS1729] 'SimpleClass11' does not contain a constructor that takes 0 arguments
```

#### Step Questions

* What is constructor overloading?
* Is it possible to instantiate the SimpleClass11 class?

```cs
SimpleClass11 simpleClass = new SimpleClass11();
```

* What are the values of the IntValue and LongValue properties after an object is initialized?

```cs
SimpleClass11 simpleClass = new SimpleClass11(-101);
int i = simpleClass.IntValue; // ?
long l = simpleClass.LongValue; // ?
```

* What are the values of the IntValue and LongValue properties after an object is initialized?

```cs
SimpleClass11 simpleClass = new SimpleClass11(202L);
int i = simpleClass.IntValue; // ?
long l = simpleClass.LongValue; // ?
```

* Whether the SimpleClass11 class is immutable or mutable class? Why?


### 18. Constructor Chaining

Create the new `SimpleClass12` class in the [SimpleClass12.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass12.cs) file, and copy all class members (instance properties and eight constructors with parameters) from the `SimpleClass11` class  to the `SimpleClass12` class.

Add a new private parameterless constructor to the class, and add the code for initializing the class instance properties with the values in the table below:

| Property      | Default Constructor Value |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| IntValue      | -983                      |
| LongValue     | -985                      |
| FloatValue    | -984.983                  |
| DoubleValue   | -9238.9634                |
| CharValue     | 'g'                       |
| BooleanValue  | true                      |
| StringValue   | "mnojkl"                  |
| ObjectValue   | null                      |

Remove properties initialization from the class constructors, and [invoke the private parameterless constructor]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-constructors)) from other class constructors with `this` keyword.

Example 18. The public constructor invokes the parameterless constructor with `this` keyword.

```cs
public SimpleClass12(int intValue)
    : this() // invoke the parameterless constructor
{
    this.IntValue = intValue;
}
```

Invoking a constructor from another constructor is called [constructor chaining](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/call-chain-constructors-csharp).

Class diagram 18. The `SimpleClass12` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass12](./images/simple-class12.png).

#### Step Questions

* What is constructor chaining?
* Is it possible to instantiate the SimpleClass12 class?

```cs
SimpleClass12 simpleClass = new SimpleClass12();
```

* What are the values of the FloatValue and DoubleValue properties after an object is initialized?

```cs
SimpleClass12 simpleClass = new SimpleClass12(123.321);
float i = simpleClass.FloatValue; // ?
double l = simpleClass.DoubleValue; // ?
```

* What are the values of the FloatValue and DoubleValue properties after an object is initialized?

```cs
SimpleClass12 simpleClass = new SimpleClass12(123.321F);
float i = simpleClass.FloatValue; // ?
double l = simpleClass.DoubleValue; // ?
```

* Whether the SimpleClass12 class is immutable or mutable class? Why?


### 19. Designing a Class with Many Constructors

Create the new `SimpleClass13` class in the [SimpleClass13.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass13.cs) file, and copy all class members (instance properties and the constructor with parameters) from the `SimpleClass10` class to the `SimpleClass13` class.

Class diagram 19. The `SimpleClass13` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass13](./images/simple-class13.png).

Analyze the class diagram above and add the public parameterless constructor and the public constructors with parameters.

Chain the public constructors in a way to invoke the constructor with "n + 1" parameters with `this` keyword using the default value from the table below:

| Property     | Default Value              |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| IntValue     | 1087                       |
| LongValue    | 10482                      |
| FloatValue   | -10387.05832               |
| DoubleValue  | -10382.73521               |
| CharValue    | 'h'                        |
| BooleanValue | false                      |
| StringValue  | "ghimnojkl"                |
| ObjectValue  | null                       |

Example 19.1. The chain of public constructors. 

```cs
public SimpleClass13()
    : this(1087) // invoke the SimpleClass13(int) constructor 
{
}

public SimpleClass13(int intValue)
    : this(intValue, 10482L)  // invoke the SimpleClass13(int, long) constructor
{
}

// TODO: add other constructors
```

Adding overloaded class constructors with various parameters is a design practice that makes the use of a class easier and you may often see such practice for BCL classes. See [StringBuilder Constructors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.stringbuilder.-ctor) documentation page.

Example 19.2. The overloaded constructors of the `StringBuilder` class.

```cs
public StringBuilder();
public StringBuilder(string value);
public StringBuilder(string value, int capacity);
public StringBuilder(string value, int startIndex, int length, int capacity);
```

#### Step Questions

* Whether the SimpleClass13 class is immutable or mutable class? Why?


### 20. Static Factory Method

Create the new `SimpleClass14` class in the [SimpleClass14.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass14.cs) file, and copy all class members (instance properties and constructors) from the `SimpleClass13` class to the `SimpleClass14` class.

Class diagram 20. The `SimpleClass14` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass14](./images/simple-class14.png).

Analyze the class diagram above and [replace constructors with static factory methods](https://refactoring.guru/replace-constructor-with-factory-method). The `Create` static methods should instantiate the `SimpleClass14` class using the default parameters from the table below: 

| Property     | Default Value              |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| IntValue     | -1132                      |
| LongValue    | -11537                     |
| FloatValue   | 11369.321                  |
| DoubleValue  | 11867.3854                 |
| CharValue    | 'i'                        |
| BooleanValue | true                       |
| StringValue  | "pqr"                      |
| ObjectValue  | null                       |

Method parameters should be used to initialize an object with parameter value.

Example 20.1. Static factory methods.

```cs
public static SimpleClass14 Create()
{
    return new SimpleClass14(-1132, -11537, 11369.321F, 11867.3854, 'i', true, "pqr", null);
}

public static SimpleClass14 Create(int intValue)
{
    return new SimpleClass14(intValue, -11537, 11369.321F, 11867.3854, 'i', true, "pqr", null); // pass intValue parameter to the SimpleClass14 constructor
}

// TODO: replace other constructors with static factory methods
```

Refactor the static factory methods (except `Create(int, long, float, double, char, bool, string, object)` method) to invoke a static method with "n + 1" parameters. Do not refactor the `Create` method with eight parameters - it should instantiate the `SimpleClass14` class with new keyword.

Example 20.2. Static factory methods after refactoring.

```cs
public static SimpleClass14 Create()
{
    return Create(-1132); // invoke Create(int) static method
}

public static SimpleClass14 Create(int intValue)
{
    return Create(intValue, -11537); // invoke Create(int, long) static method
}

// TODO: refactor other static methods

public static SimpleClass14 Create(int intValue, long longValue, float floatValue, double doubleValue, char charValue, bool boolValue, string stringValue, object objectValue)
{
    return new SimpleClass14(intValue, longValue, floatValue, doubleValue, charValue, boolValue, stringValue, objectValue);
}
```

An [Activator class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.activator) has multiple [CreateInstance methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.activator.createinstance) that in fact are static factory methods: 

```cs
public static object? CreateInstance(Type type)
public static object? CreateInstance(Type type, bool nonPublic);
public static object? CreateInstance(Type type, params object?[]? args);
public static object? CreateInstance (Type type, object?[]? args, object?[]? activationAttributes);
// etc...
```

### 21. Optional Parameters and Named Arguments

Create the new `SimpleClass15` class in the [SimpleClass15.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass15.cs) file, and copy instance properties and the constructor only from the `SimpleClass14` class to the `SimpleClass15` class.

Class diagram 21. The `SimpleClass15` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass15](./images/simple-class15.png).

Copy the `Create(int, long, float, double, char, bool, string, object)` method from the `SimpleClass14` class to `SimpleClass15` class, and make the [method parameters optional](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments#optional-arguments) by adding a default value to each method parameter.

| Method Parameter | Default Value              |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| intValue         | 12354                      |
| longValue        | -12134                     |
| floatValue       | -12846.973                 |
| doubleValue      | 12923.6374                 |
| charValue        | 'j'                        |
| boolValue        | true                       |
| stringValue      | "pqrmno"                   |
| objectValue      | null                       |

Example 21.1. Declaring an optional parameter with a constant expression as a default value. 

```cs
public static SimpleClass15 Create(
    int intValue = 12354,
    // TODO: add other method parameters here with default values
)
{
    return new SimpleClass15(intValue, longValue, floatValue, doubleValue, charValue, boolValue, stringValue, objectValue);
}
```

Implement methods in the [CreatingSimpleClass15](UmlDesignBasics/CreatingSimpleClass15.cs) class by invoking the `Create` method to create an object of the `SimpleClass15` class.

Example 21.2. The `CreateSimpleClass15WithDefaultValues` method implementation. 

```cs
public static object CreateSimpleClass15WithDefaultValues()
{
    return SimpleClass15.Create();
}
```

Use [named arguments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments#named-arguments) to pass arguments to the `SimpleClass15.Create` method.  

Example 21.3. Named arguments. 

```cs
public static object CreateSimpleClass15(double doubleValue)
{
    return SimpleClass15.Create(doubleValue: doubleValue);
}
```


#### Step Questions

* What is an optional parameter?
* What is a named argument?
* Is it possible to have an optional parameter with default value initialized with default keyword?

```cs
public static SimpleClass15 Create(
    int intValue = default(int)
    // other parameters
) {
    // ...
}
```

* Is it possible to have an optional parameter with default value initialized with a new object?

```cs
public static SimpleClass15 Create(
    // other parameters
    object objectValue = new object()
) {
    // ...
}
```
* Whether the `SimpleClass15` class is immutable or mutable class? Why?


### 22. Constants

Create the new static `SimpleStaticClass5` class in the [SimpleStaticClass5.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleStaticClass5.cs) file, and define [public constants](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-define-constants) using the information from the table below:

| Constant     | Constant Value                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Pi           | 3.14159653589793238            |
| SpeedOfLight | 300 * 1000                     |
| BitsInByte   | 2 * 2 + 16 / 4                 |
| Tau          | 3.1415925 * 2                  |
| NewLine      | '\n'                           |
| BoolValue    | true && false && false         |
| HelloWorld   | "Hello" + ", " + "world" + "!" |

Example 22. Public constant.

```cs
public const double Pi = 3.14159653589793238;
// TODO: add other constants here
```

#### Additional Reading

Read more about constants in [Constants (C# Programming Guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constants) article: 

> Constants are immutable values which are known at compile time and do not change for the life of the program. Only the C# built-in types (excluding System.Object) may be declared as const. User-defined types, including classes, structs, and arrays, cannot be const. Use the readonly modifier to create a class, struct, or array that is initialized one time at runtime (for example in a constructor) and thereafter cannot be changed.

#### Step Questions

* What is a constant?
* How to declare a constant?
* What types may be declared as a constant?
* Does C# support const properties?
* Why a developer should use caution referring to constant values defined in other code such as DLLs?


### 23. Read-only Fields

Create the new `SimpleClass16` class in the [SimpleClass16.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleClass16.cs) file, and add public constants using the information from the table below:

| Constant            | Constant Value |
|---------------------|----------------|
| DefaultIntValue     | -135914        |
| DefaultLongValue    | 138672         |
| DefaultFloatValue   | 130124.58123   |
| DefaultDoubleValue  | -130521.71531  |
| DefaultCharValue    | 'k'            |
| DefaultBoolValue    | false          |
| DefaultStringValue  | "stuvwx"       |
| DefaultObjectValue  | null           |

Add private instance fields with [`readonly` modifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/readonly).

Example 23.1. The declaration of an instance field with the `readonly` modifier.

```cs
private readonly int intField;
// TODO: add other readonly fields here.
```

Add a constructor with parameters, use the parameters to initialize instance fields, and make the [constructor parameters optional](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments#optional-arguments) by setting the constants as default values.

Example 23.2. Using a constant as default value for an optional constructor parameter.

```cs
public SimpleClass16(
    int intValue = DefaultIntValue,
    // TODO: add other parameters
) {
    this.intField = intValue;
    // TODO: set other fields here
}
```

Add public properties with "get" accessors only that should return the instance field values.

Example 23.3. The declaration of a public property with "get" accessor.

```cs
public int IntValue { get => this.intField; }
```

Class diagram 23. The `SimpleClass16` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleClass16](./images/simple-class16.png).

Implement methods in the [CreatingSimpleClass16](UmlDesignBasics/CreatingSimpleClass16.cs) class returning new objects of `SimpleClass16` class.

Example 23.4. The `CreateSimpleClass16WithDefaultValues` method implementation.

```cs
public static object CreateSimpleClass16WithDefaultValues()
{
    return new SimpleClass16();
}
```

Use named arguments to pass arguments to the `SimpleClass16` constructor.

Another way to implement a property with "get" accessory only is to use [read-only property syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members#read-only-properties).

Example 23.5. The declaration of a read-only property.

```cs
public int IntValue => this.intField;
```

Remove the properties you declared in the `SimpleClass16` and use the [Encapsulate field](https://learn.microsoft.com/sk-sk/visualstudio/ide/reference/encapsulate-field) refactoring to declare read-only properties for all fields of the class.

![Encapsulate field](./images/encapsulate-property-to-auto-property.png)

#### Step Questions

* What is a read-only field?
* How to declare a read-only field?
* Is it true that a const field is a run-time constant and the read-only field can be used for compile-time constants?
* Whether it is possible for a property to have only a "get" accessor?
* Whether it is possible for a property to have only a "set" accessor?
* Does a read-only property have both "get" and "set" accessors?
* Whether the SimpleClass16 class is immutable or mutable class? Why?


### 24. Static Constructors

Create the new static `SimpleStaticClass6` class in the [SimpleStaticClass6.cs](UmlDesignBasics/SimpleStaticClass6.cs) file, and add public static readonly fields.

Class diagram 23. The `SimpleStaticClass6` class.

![Class Diagram for SimpleStaticClass6](./images/simple-static-class6.png).

Example 24.1. The declaration of a static field with the `readonly` modifier.

```cs
public static readonly object IntType;
// TODO: add other fields here
```

Add a [static constructor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-constructors) and initialize static fields with values from the table below: 

| Field Name   | Value          |
|--------------|----------------|
| IntType      | typeof(int)    |
| LongType     | typeof(long)   |
| FloatType    | typeof(float)  |
| DoubleType   | typeof(double) |
| CharType     | typeof(char)   |
| BooleanType  | typeof(bool)   |
| StringType   | typeof(string) |

Example 24.2. The declaration of a static constructor.

```cs
static SimpleStaticClass6()
{
    IntType = typeof(int);
    // TODO: initialize other fields here
}
```
